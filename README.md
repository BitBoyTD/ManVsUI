# ManVsUI
Gives Mr Plant's manvsmaths.com a fresh new look and added customizability!

Man Vs UI is an open source chrome extension created by Se√°n Osborne who finished coding the initial version of it on Tue 26 Sep 2023.
It was created to remedy Mr Plant's questionable web design skills and give his website, manvsmaths.com, a new, less gag inducing look.

For those of you who are pretty tech savy and want to give this extension your own spin, feel free to download the raw files from this repository 
and edit the stylesheets to your hearts content. As long as you don't edit the names of the stylesheets, it should still work perfectly fine.

As of today (26/09/2023) the extension is not on the chrome webstore, but will be coming soon.
